# cv-application

I created this web application for creating and generating cv's in PDF format. It was my first time using React, and I had the opportunity to learn about the fundamental concepts of React, such as using useState and passing data between components via props.

# Technologies Used

## Here are the key technologies I used in this project:

jsPDF: Allow users to generate and download cv as PDF,

React: I built this project using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allowed me to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Key React Features That Were in Prominent Use :
* useState: As a newcomer to React, I used the useState hook to manage and update the state within my application. It was a crucial part of capturing user inputs and updating the components based on that data.
* Props: To pass data between components, I made use of React's props. This allowed me to send information from the parent component (App) to child components (inputComponents and cvRender) seamlessly. Props enabled the flow of data, making it possible to display and manage user input throughout the application.
